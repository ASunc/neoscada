The most important for new are the two files called &#8220;world.escm&#8221; and &#8220;world.esim&#8221;. Which are the component model (escm) and the infrastructure model (esim).</p><p>The component model holds all components that the system is made of where the infrastructure model describes the technical infrastructure (like nodes, technical services, applications, deployments).</p><h2 id="Createsomedeploymentmechanism">Create some deployment mechanism</h2><p>In order to create ready to install .deb or .rpm packages you will need to add the deployment mechanism to the target node.</p><p>Select the SystemNode object, from the Infrastructure Model, that you would like to create packages for, right click and add either a Debian Deployment Descriptor or a Redhat Deployment Descriptor.</p><p>Be sure to fill out the maintainer field and create at least one change entry (child element). The maintainer can be referenced from the file called &#8220;deployment.information.esdi&#8221; that was created during project creation in the &#8220;global&#8221; folder. In order to assign the maintainer properly to the main element and the change entry element you will need to right click on some element of the infrastructure model and select &#8220;Load Resource…&#8221;. This will bring up a dialog which lets you choose how to load a resource. Select &#8220;Browse Workspace…&#8221; and select the file &#8220;global/deployment.information.esdi&#8221;. You can now select a maintainer from the list.</p><p>Running the recipe again will now create a .deb or .rpm file, depending on your configuration.</p><p><em>Note</em> you will need to have &#8220;debuild&#8221; or &#8220;rpmbuild&#8221; installed for actually creating packages. </p></body></html>
